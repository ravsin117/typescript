what ts does :
it is for static checking (like in java)
whenever we are writing the code the syntax of the code is monitered by ide but not in case of js , wnd when we execute the errors are thrown , so it will be great if we had a static checker .
it checks and gives us hint about what is wrong in our code 

development process : 
code writen in ts file or tsx(ts + jsx) file 
this code transpiled in js 

ts -> it is dev tool ,& projects still runs in js 
ts is superset of js 

types in ts :  
-number string boolean 
-null undefined void 
-object array tuples ...
-Any (more like js as we dont have to worry about type )
-never 
-unknown

declaring varibles 

let variableName : type = value
